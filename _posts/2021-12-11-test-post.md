title: Setting up boilerplate code for docker and flask
---

After gathering a set of requirements from the users, the team had a discussion on the implementation details of the project. It was sepcified that the end product of the project is a web application that can be viewed from a laptop or smart phone. Hence, we did some research on web frameworks and consulted our supervisor to get some advice. We decided to use Flask, a lightweight python web framework, to build our web application. Applying knowledge of Docker containers learnt from the COMP0010 (Software Engineering) module, I initialised a docker container along with the boilerplate code for Flask.
